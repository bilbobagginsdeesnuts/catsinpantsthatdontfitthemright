    <ul class="c8 lst-kix_le376ks6n71v-0 start">
        <li ><p><b>Severance - </b>look its still good, theres a
                part where someone gets a list of grievances printed in an properly bound book and the graphic design on
                it is nuts and now the cinematographer is directing and they are ever so talanted</p></li>
        <li ><p><b>Paradise - </b>I started watching this
                because i thought it would be a fun murder mystery but its far more of a political thriller, its wierdly
                wierd? No i don&#39;t know what that means - its fine. Its pretty good but there are some bits that are
                very signposted and other bits that i felt came outta nowhere and theyve got a 2nd season confirmed and
                i have so many thoughts about where the fuck its going to go next</p></li>
        <li ><p><b>Happy Endings - </b>This is a strange show,
                its the reason that coach isnt in the first season of new girl, its a sitcom about 6 friends and the
                pilot is literally two of them getting married and she runs out on him. He then gets depressed and
                immediately i was like. Yes. whenever this man succeeds i am upset but whenever something bad happens to
                him i am sat up straight. No expression on my face as i whisper to myself &ldquo;good&rdquo;. He at one
                point finds out his 1/16th native american and goes super fucking hard into it and its just real white
                boy hour. The best part is the guy from new girl and the gay guy but also its aged sorta poorly which is
                wild as i was about to be like &ldquo;oh its in that era before shows were like willing to not punch
                down as much like community&rdquo; but community started in 2009 and this started in 2011. A few weeks
                after this started a fistfull of paintballs aired hot dog. </p></li>
        <li ><b>From</b>- This shit feels like a
                mystery pass the parcle where every time a layer is removed you just realise theres more of an mystery
                under the layer you removed but also it has the guy who voiced owen in total drama island in it and
                thats cool. Ive just finished the 3rd season and it feels like its actually unravelled one of the layers
                in a meaningful way but now i have to wait till probs nextyear for more so oh well. Dunno why im on such
                a mystery box hit this month</p></li>
        <li ><p><b>The Davinci Code </b><p>- i saw that dan brown
                had a new book in this series coming out so i thought &ldquo;yeah fuck it, ill watch the movie&rdquo;
                and holy shit was it bad. First off i accidenly sourced the directors cut so it was almost 3 hours long,
                but also it didnt come with subtitles so the first 50 mins any time leon the professional was talking in
                french i was just nodding along occasionally picking up on words but mostly going &ldquo;i wonder if
                this is better with subtitles&rdquo;. By the time the guy from angie tribeca showed up and had a full
                scene not in english i snappes and found my own subtitles (the ones plex provided were either 5 seconds
                fast or 5 seconds slow). The strange thing about the entire movie is that ron howard is sorta cooking?
                Like the script is nonsense and tom hanks is giving the worst performance ive ever seen from him but
                there are some cool visuals in the movie! It just doesnt help that i guessed the whole &ldquo;direct
                blood decendant of jesus christ&rdquo; thing about halfway through so when it fucking dragged out the
                reveal over 10 mins i was in agony. Will i watch the rest of them? I dunno. Its currenlty 10pm on
                saturday the 15th and oh no im gonna do it now aren&#39;t i</p></li>
        <li ><p><b>Angles and Demons</b>&nbsp;- this opens with some truly
                beautiful shots of the big science thing in CERN and i really think that ron howard (massive nerd) got
                the permission to film in there and went fuckin hog wild - like you can skip through them talking no in
                english and also the fact that a priest is in the hadron collider but the opening shots are shot by a
                guy who was just facinated by what it was </span><span class="c4"><a class="c7"

                fuckin ticking timb bomb that made sense, the threat was real the twist was obvious and ewen mcgregor
                was supposed to be from ireland but sounded 100% just himself but it was fine. Also it was about a
                conclave and every time they would do something conclave related id do the leo meme excited that i know
                about that because i saw conclave. Also the entire movie is them racing to stop this bomb from going
                off, but in the end it goes off and it fucking does damage. There are several shots of crowds being
                blown back, buildings being destroyed and i just kept laughing to myself about how ridiculous it was.

                wipe out half the population and that might just sting. Idk why but i just really couldnt focus on it.
                Was boring. Played balatro. </p></li>
        <li ><p><b>Captain america brave new world order or whatever its called -
        </b>I really think im over marvel. I know this is a hot take to say now (i will
                absolutely be watching daredevil now fisk is the mayor or whatever its called) but this one was like .
                just eh to me? I remember the falcon and winter soldier show feeling like a movie that was chopped to
                bits to remove the pandemic storyline and now this feels like a movie thats been reshot to death to
                introduce new plot lines that sorta go nowhere and also cut around the fact one of the lead characters
                is marvel comics big &ldquo;isreal #1&rdquo; super hero (rumours say they cast her right before the
                genoside started and have been just slowly cutting out her scenes as they got closer to release) anyway
                like 3/10 - was eh. It also felt rushed. And yes. That might be because i watched it at 1.5x because it
                seemed boring but theres no fucking scenes! Everything was just exposition and then moving on. Wait no
                there was one bit at the start but it was with the new falcon guy and he is too quipy i cannot stand him
                anyway its hilarious taht they peaked with the winter soldier and ahve been chasing that high ever since
                (if the movie just slowed down and let scenes play out it would be better) </p></li>
        <li ><p><b>Hadestown -</b>see below, i loved it. </span>
        </li>
        <li ><p><b>Candide </b>- this was an opera. Now
                you might be going &ldquo;jack i thought you hated the idea of an opera&rdquo; and oh boy i was right,
                the best part was eddie perfect playing the narrator but basically as aussie beetlejuice. I do think the
                plot of the show was a lot of fun and finding out it was made through spite? Oh it made me adore it even
                more. Every song made me want to get up and leave tho that was a lot - oh i just remember i mainly went
                to it as i saw steven sondehim did some of the lyrics but i really think i saw a version of the show
                that he didnt because theres multiple long blog posts about his contribution to the show and it seems
                like most of it is not a lot. </p></li>
        <li ><p><b>From the Apple Tree </b>- This was an
                small production of three small musicals, all with common themes. It was a lot of fun but really none of
                the songs stood out (its from the 60s when the best thing was the original west side story ew) but the
                stories were pretty fun. Also it tought me that adam and eve were the parents to the kid who beans his
                brother on the head. </p></li>
        <li ><p><b>Wuthering heights - </b>I had no idea what
                this book was but this musical? Stage play? Operatic version of the story was nuts, or maybe the story
                itself was nuts but it was so electric and wonderful and fucking bananas? And also having a POC playing
                heathclif makes so much sense why do they keep casting white men ughk, also turns out this was straight
                off the west end cast so there is a proshoot of this exact show which is great because act 2 has a
                character as a ghost just lurking around the stage. Also the moore is the ensemble and its such a cool
                idea</p></li>
        <li ><p><b>Presence</b>- this just feels like
                soderbergh showing off, its shot at 14mm and so its super fucking wide angle, honestly it is so good i
                don&#39;t wanna spoil it. The movies under 90 mins (if it was any longer it probs wouldve gotten old) i
                don&#39;t think its showing in many theatres but you can always sail the seas its so good. Actually fuck
                it this isnt a spoiler its in the trailer - Every time someone just clocks the camera my body fully
                shivered it was so spooky, also its a ghost story where its not jumpscare central! </p></li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="c6" id="h.bo86svi6qg7j"><span class="c2">Hadestown</span></h1>
    <p class="c0"><p>Ive seen it twice. Both times the gasps from the audience when he fails the challenge
            got me (i was already very crying at that point, hearing sniffles from the crowd during the final reprise
            rules). The first time was opening night and the second was the premier. Seeing it in a crowd full of people
            who are fucking here for it was incredible. The cheers after each song was so good and getting to feel the
            trumpet going in my bones at the start was iconic. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c5"><p></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><p>Also they gave us flowers on opening night but they were real and mine has finally
            withered which feels like a beautiful metaphor for what the show was</span></p>

    <h1 class="c6" id="h.bkgrf75f69wo"><span class="c2">Tech in movies</span></h1>
    <p class="c0"><p>So im a ners i know that but one thing i like when watching movies is seeing an phone
            or laptop that is an dead flop. Like in several movies they use the surface duo, the microsoft phone that
            has 2 screens (it was in captain america) and also in paradise they i think are using the essentials phone
            (aka the phone created by the founder of android who was ford out of google because he was a sex pest and
            went bust after a year). The two davinci code movies are fascinating because both are sony movies so
            everything is sony branded. Sony handy cam. Sony vaio laptop with media playback buttons with a lock (turns
            out this was so they could secretly record the pope) and also the sony logo right in shot. The funny thing
            is this is the era when having a sony laptop wasnt such an laughing matter. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c5"><p></span></p>

    <p class="c0 c5"><p></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><p>Also this is a pic from the latest ep of PAradise, ive blurred whats on the tv for
            spoilers sake but look at how theyve put the tv legs on backwards to fit it onto this trolley, this tv is on
            screen for like 10 seconds and some poor prop person had to do this to make it work. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c5"><p></span></p>
    <h1 class="c6" id="h.adatmhgv36ed"><span class="c2">The Rest is Entertainment</span></h1>
    <p class="c0"><p>Ok so this is a podcast that makes me more mad then hell but for some reason i still
            occasionally listen and fuckin oath. Its hosted by richard osman (the tall man from s2 of taskmaster and the
            host of richard somans house of games and a producer on the original uk run of whose line and also an author
            my mum loves) and mariana hide (i think she writes for the guardian uk?) and its fascinating because they
            have such a wealth and depth of knowledge about british tv shows when richard can just call up his producer
            friend and find out about how they make a show and what now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c5"><p></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>But then whenever they talk about movies they are so unbelievably out of their depth and they
            disudiscussed mr beast and youtube they sound 100 years old. The reason i bring them up now is that the
            reason iw atched the dan brown movies (at time of writing ive only seen 2 of them but i can feel inferno
            itching away at the back of my head and oh no theres a prequel tv show i shant be doing that) and they kept
            saying &ldquo;oh well dan sells a lot of copies of his book. You can say its trash but he sells&rdquo; and i
            was like &ldquo;ok what about the movie&rdquo; and fucking hell its trash. Like not just trash but bin juice
            thats been left in the sun on accident as you went away for a month and left a bin bag on your balcony - ive
            just put on the trailer for inferno and fuckin oath its about dantes inferno this is gonna be insufferable.

    <p class="c0"><p>Having my brainoct in on some fuckin piece of tech thinking &ldquo;well if I had that
            then it would fof me and my life would be so much better&rdquo; keeps happening. I just wanna outline some
            of them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c5"><p></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><p>The first was the beepy, basically a blackberry that has a raspberry pi zero in it
            and runs full linum it&#39;s made by the guy who made the pebbelnwatch and also created an app that lets you
            have all of your chat apps in one. The main idea behind this device is you could do all of your chats from
            there (or at least that&#39;s what I think, very few of these were made and there&#39;s little information
            about it beyond a discord of 12 people who are constantly dealing with people who join asking if more will
            be made or when they&#39;re going on sale again and tell them it&#39;s absondonwear basically or you buy a
            colour one for 400 AUD. Note I&#39;m not doing that I don&#39;t need one that bad) anyway. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c5"><p></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><p>I&#39;ve started wearing watched (the cool old Casio digitals as they&#39;re tiny)
            and I get the idea of a smart watch now but the size of the pixel watch (and also that fuckin nothing one I
            bought) really turn me away from it. But ages ago I remembered that I got two seperate pebbles for Christmas
            (one bulky launch one and the other the slimmer and colour screened pebble time) and went &ldquo;I should
            try using them again&rdquo; one ritalin later and I had ripped apart my draws (where I thought they were)
            with an unsuccessful search and I&#39;m honestly gonna go look again becuase they&#39;re in my old room
            somewhere ive just gotta get high af and search properly becuase they are expensive on eBay and also ew
            it&#39;s a used watch. But fuck the time round is so sexy and thin ughkt</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c5"><p></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><p>Anyway basically this one nerd made two cool devices and his making a new one so
            anyway I dunno what this is about I&#39;m on the train to circular quey to see an operah now and I don&#39;t
            know why I&#39;m doing this, I only really got it becuase it has Eddie perfect in it and it&#39;s the
            version that has some Sondheim lyrics? But honestly Sondheim is such a goated composer becuase he does both
            anyway belles hot chicken why is this down here jack close google docs</span></p>

            sprinting to just two bits of ham going for it gets me every time. Also i found out the concert of the show
            is this guy and his gf are on the show to see if she can not give in to temptation and i feel so bad for
            this guy because he has to watch while she gets down. The host just having to sit there and watch with him
