    <p class="c1"><span><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A big theme for the start of this month was my works christmas party, I love this
            costume i made for the gameshow host for my work christmas party, i forgot about the hat in the end but the
            jacket that doesnt fit is a wonderful vibe</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know why i put this flyer from the prime minister in the sink but it felt
            good</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span><img alt="" src="images/image15.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh god on the friday night before my works christmas conference on the monday i spent
            an few hours making these blades (based on the company logo) and then went to hang them up in the empty
            office we were using for the conference</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought it would make the room look and feel less empty but i was so wrong it
            looked just as depressing</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span><img alt="" src="images/image7.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The game i made was fun tho, i made it windows xp themed because the whole thing was
            based on the us office (i had to bite my tongue so often as people said it was better than 30 rock and parks
            and rec)</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span><img alt="" src="images/image14.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of my bosses made the jelly stapler and it was a wild choice, no one ate it at
            all but i egged her on into flipping it and running it</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">They also made us all wear these tshirts for the 2nd day of the conference so i
            rebelled and wore this shirt over it and the neckerchief as i don&#39;t wear
            black!</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went to a real fancy place for lunch and god it was embarrassing everyone wearing
            the same shirt but i survived, they had a big tree! And it was greek and we ended up drinking 2.5 bottles of
            white wine and 3 bottles of red just between 7 of us</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Continuing my grandmothers tradition of making snowballs for christmas i do love them
            so, theyre somewhat a pain to make (only because of the mess) but damn are they nice. Also i remember my
            grandmother once being like &ldquo;no don&#39;t buy the cheap coconut get the good stuff&rdquo; and having
            made it on both the cheap and good stuff she isnt wrong, youve gotta use the good stuff otherwise the
            texture is dogshit</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span><img alt="" src="images/image10.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">During one of the 40c days i mcguivered this hood onto the top of a portable ac to
            run it from my bathroom into my lounge room, it worked! Except the piping was made ofa foil so it got very
            condensed and also it didnt really cool the apartment down but hey. Summer in the city and all that</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>

    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">At christmas my mum had an old art book of mine and i used to be an true
            artist</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span><img alt="" src="images/image9.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I spent christmas night and boxing day with my mum as she house and cat sit for a
            friend, and felix (the cat) was such a friendly motherfucker it was wild, he fell asleep in my legs at one
            point and i loved it but also was like &ldquo;no but i have the adhd urge to move what do i do&rdquo;</span>

    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_le376ks6n71v-0 start">
        <li class="c1 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Pluribus - i really loved this, do i think the lesbian shippers
                on twitter are somwhat misguided in their beliefs? Yes. however i think this show has got some gas in
                it! Rhea Seehorn plays it so well and im excited for this show to get a few more seasons and then
                hopefully take a bow out before it gets too long in the tooth, oh whats that next oh huh</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Stranger things s5 part 2 - this was less of an enjoyable watch
                and more of an exercise in the sunk cost fallacy. I hate it and i think it needs to die. The crazy thing
                is how much of this season i was like &ldquo;Wait i already know this?&rdquo; and that is purely down to
                having seen the stage play which already setup a few things that i wont spoil here just incase anyone
                cares. </span></li>
        <li class="c1 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Love actually - this movie felt like adhd, ive never seen it
                before but it was great. I finally got why people wanted to fuck alan rickman and also hugh grant, the
                way everything kept stringing together was lovely and rowan atkinson as a christmas angel being is
                wonderful (fucking rickman)</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Five nights at freddies 2 - was this a masterpiece? No! Did it do
                the sequel thing of doing the first movie again but now because its a franchise it has to setup things
                for potential sequels? Yes! Anyway was a delight and the puppet can go fuck itself, but it was lovely to
                watch with friend mae</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Avatar 3 - was this good? I don&#39;t know? I enjoyed it but like
                objectively was it good? It was clear that its part 2 of the avatar 2 script thats for sure but like, it
                was fun! Jake looked hot in the helicopter scene and the goth lady was funny but i don&#39;t know what
                else to say. I was sad when the hot air balloon went down tho</span></li>
        <li class="c1 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Fallout s2 - so far its been fun! Again hate that people on
                twitter are shipping lucy and the ghoul because ew but its still a bit of fun! </span></li>
        <li class="c1 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Metroid prime 4 beyond - did i finish the first prime game before
                this came out? No. have i now finished 4? Yes. it was fun! Clearly inspired far too much by breath of
                the wild in terms of the big desert and the four temples but hey, theres a bit where samus looses her
                new suit and it goes back to being orange and i out loud to myself went &ldquo;fuck that suit is
                iconic&rdquo; </span></li>
        <li class="c1 c5 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Dogpile - game good, you drop dogs in an pile (like suika not
                2048 as 2048 is a grid fuck you eric) and then you get balatro like upgrades - is good!! Its been out
                for a few weeks and im already at 24.6 hours</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="c7" id="h.bo86svi6qg7j"><span class="c3">On the topic of yodelling</span></h1>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">All of you should&rsquo;ve received the gift and hopefully opened it on christmas
            day. I hope you all enjoy the cassette tape which i think only one or two of you will actually be able to
            listen to but for the rest of you isnt it a fun thing to have on a shelf! </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The back story to this was i was at reverse garbage (A likely place for me to be) and
            they had a tub full to the brim with these tapes. And suddenly it hit me that like. Thats a good bit! So i
            bought 20 tapes, wrapped them individually (some of them are better than others wrapping wise and thats
            purely down to the fact i got better as i went) and then started the tedious process of getting them to you
            all. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>

    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of you aren&#39;t in australia so that was an annoying trip to the post office
            filling out custom forms and also currently if your shipping to america you cant just use the online form
            you have to tlak to the man so that was an entire lunch break but its good! Then the domestic ones were not
            as annoying but it still took me half an hour to fill in all the envelopes and then legit 10 mins at the
            counter for them all to be scanned in. and for the sydney friends well i can just see you guys so its not
            hard. But i did have them in my bag when i saw avatar 3 so thats fun. And two people immediately tried to
            open them upon receiving them but they whats christmas! </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">So anyway im writing this before christmas so im excited to in like oh god its 10pm,
            one of you is gonna open it at the stroke of midnight im calling it now. But in the morning i excited to
            start receiving bewildered messages of &ldquo;jack wtf is this&rdquo; and i will just be laughing musically
        </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h1 class="c7" id="h.h7xya1lr3tq5"><span class="c3">On the topic of my grandparents trying to solve the drama i have
            with my dad at christmas lunch</span></h1>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">(im just gonna put a warning here that this contains strong language, why? I dunno
            but part of me is like &ldquo;well emily has a baby and what if the baby somehow reads this even tho the
            baby is 8 months old anyway for th rest of you fuck shit piss cunt)</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">God i have so much to scream about this, im writing this on christmas eve but
            yesterday i finally talked to my mum about the email i received from my grandfather which is below. My mums
            reaction was &ldquo;ok jack you have to just shut up and do the handshake to appease them but we are going
            to do it in private and not infront of the extended family&rdquo; and i kept bemoaning that i am not ready
            to actually forgive him and that im fucking pissed off at my grandparents for trying to insert themselves in
            as mediators when they refuse to actually hear my side and just keep insisting that i should forgive and
            forget because their cunt of a son can do no wrong. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ok sorry got heated there but anyway that was a fun way to ruin a christmas eve eve
            shopping trip with my mum, but eventually i drive home and i start stewing on all the things im pissed at
            him for and end up having to pull over and reply to the email saying no because i was on the verge of tears
            just driving home just thinking about this. And then he fucking replied saying &ldquo;oh no i wasnt asking
            for an actual handshake heaven no&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">So my fucking grandfather esentially just sent a boomer bible quote as a like
            &ldquo;build a bridge and get over it&rdquo; thing which was not at all what any of us interpreted it as.
            And now i have to go to christmas lunch with them. Yipee. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span>Update, it went fine and turns out i misread the email and the email was basically &ldquo;oht he
            bondi attack scared me jack you should just build a bridge and get over it&rdquo; fun times</span></p>

    <h1 class="c7" id="h.bkgrf75f69wo"><span class="c3">Paddington bear the musical</span></h1>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am 7 minutes into this and i have spent most of it in tears? The bear is so fucking
            cute and the way his revealed is so nice?? I think the reason its fucking me up so much is that when i was a
            kid my great grandmother in england didnt know what to sent me so i was sent tellitubies and padington bear
            vhs&rsquo;s that were tapped off the tv and then toys along with it which like. a) super smart, wanna make
            sure the kid gets the reference? Send the source. b) i also remember not being able to read her handwriting
            except once when she wrote in block letters for me and it was so nice sorry this is now just me remembering
            great granny davenport, she always wrote in these like airmail letters which were blue and tri fold. Also
            when she died her ashes were scattered off Dunoon in scotland so when my mum and i went last year we went to
            glasgow to pay our respects and itw as nice (even tho we were just on the water because getting to dunoon
            wouldve been so annoying) - also we had a drink and my mum full on said &ldquo;oh she was a big drinker she
            wouldve loved this&rdquo; so thats nice. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
