    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">Went to a bar for isabellas birthday and they had a signed bradbery picture, there
            was a tonne of them on the walls which was a real throwback to my dads work when i was growing up but this
            one is just nice to see, good on him</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span><img alt="" src="images/image10.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">As apart of having to deal with my grandparents stuff my mum now has most of it, and
            the breadth of different types of cards he had were staggering, like why the fuck does alice springs have an
            hotel casino? Is it still there? Why am i not in the alice springs casino wearing shorts and a hawaiian
            shirt drinking thooeys new and loosing the house? Why is that not the dream!</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">In a continuing trend i get bored during work meetings and doodle, im just proud of
            myself not drawing any dicks. I don&#39;t think any of these things have names but if youve got any ideas
            hit me up</span></p>

    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">Ok this is the kfc bahn mi. Ordering this was a real low point in my mental health.
            And it did not help one fucking bit. Its basically an twister but in a baguette. The sauce is so
            overpowering and bad - the veggies mixed with them stink. I can confidently say that ive bounced back from
            this low and now know to not order it again. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span><img alt="" src="images/image15.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">I was in the westfield in the city killing time before a show and saw a huge fucking
            line for the oasis tour merch store and was like &ldquo;lmao oasis are in town cool, why do people want
            merch&rdquo; (this is what good writers call foreshadowing)</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>

                title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">I saw the lovers and ill put thoughts further down but the main thing is, both men
            started off looking real hot in all black and ruffles. Then they came out in this denim which did no favours
            for either of them. I also got rush tickets and was sat front row so had a real good look at them and like.
            God the baggy shorts on the guy int he middle what has fashion come to</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">Went to the post office to get my passport renewed and saw this, a fucking nigthmare.
            Also i couldnt get it renewed this day because my printer cut off the last cm which has an important
            barcode.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span><img alt="" src="images/image16.jpg" title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">So i went to a different one the next day with the correct thing, and the woman kept
            being like &ldquo;oh your middle names are so regal! Like a king!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span><img alt="" src="images/image8.jpg"
                title=""></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">Ok so remember when i was like &ldquo;whose going to oasis?&rdquo; well on the friday
            i found a ticket for 80 bucks and then i was there saturday night, honestly i knew like barley any of the
            songs but i had a blast! Wonderwall? Oh its beautiful to hear live. As is champaign supanova. At one point
            the one who wears the hat lit up a ciggie and it was great. What wasnt great was the 3 hours it took for me
            to get home because fuck sydney olympic park and fuck all the british people i had to endure in the crowd,
            who were so annoying and also annoyed that the opener act was too aussie and liK EYOU ARE IN SYDNEY FUCK
            OFF. GO BACK TO THE COLD AND DEPRESSING ENGLAND AND LIVE IN THE MISSERABLE GRAY DON&#39;T COME HERE AND THEN

            and the bartender looked so happy that she got to make it, and honestly. Im so annoyed because it was so
            fucking drinkable. It was so sweet and good and it was like $200 but like oh man delish. One day the volcano
            will be bought also the other bartender staring in the background is hilairous</span></p>

    <ul class="c6 lst-kix_le376ks6n71v-0 start">
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">The Lovers - ok so this show is pitched as &ldquo;what if
                shakespeare midsummer night dream was pop&rdquo; and its a fine idea but it doesnt stick with it? Like
                it flutters between being a faithful adaptation and a camp 90s boyband adaptation and i think thats
                where it suffers? Also theyve fucked the pricing of this because it was half empty when i saw it but
                there were some teens that looked excited and like it shouldve been packed with young people being
                invigorated by it. </span></li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Wake up dead man - the new knives out movie! It comes out on netflix
                in dec but like god i loved it. I wont spoil it further than saying what it has to say about the church
                is interesting and the way the lighting works in the church is outstanding. Also im now pumped more than
                anything for glen close to make the sunset bulivard musical movie and to star in it because she is
                outstanding and i can see her playing that desperation perfectly</span></li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Frankenstine - i have never seen an frank adaptation, so i knew
                nothing and oh man i had a blast. So much of the cinematography had me gripped and the creature was
                fuckin outstanding. Also in one scene oscar isac wears a coat and hat and i was fully seated in the
                cinema like &ldquo;oh i get it with him huh&rdquo; and had to spend the rest of the movie like &ldquo;oh
                yeah ok yep fine man&rdquo;</span></li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Escape from new york - this fits perfectly into the description of
                movies from the 80s just being dirty. But kurt russel is so fuckin hot in it his introduction is so hot
                and then ughk just a lot of fun and also like maybe its also attitude. </span></li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Black bag - ok speaking of hot michal fastbander is so autistic
                coded but also outstanding, this is a movie about a spy couple dealing with spy shit but its not like
                &ldquo;oh im stalking this hotel room&rdquo; but its &ldquo;we have to have a conversation and work out
                whose lying&rdquo; and its thrilling - there are multiple dinner parties and each is a delight</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Stranger Things s5 - ok so. Is it good? Not really, is it fun? I
                don&#39;t know. I kinda just wanna see how it ends? But also there are at least 2 references to the
                stage play i saw and im like &ldquo;how have they made a prequal and not done a proshoot&rdquo; because
                theres a third reference that i know is coming that they havent touched yet but will be interesting. I
                really think the time jump hurts it but also knowing that most of the cast hated it makes sense?</span>
        </li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Plur1bus - even if this show is just labeled as an big budget xfiles
                show its still good! Do i know where its going? Not at all! The only theory i had was something about
                carol being an author and creativity being important but now i think thats nothing so who knows! All i
                know is im thrilled</span></li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">30 rock on shuffle - i put this on in the background while i was
                doing chores and truly i think 30 rock is one of my favourite shows of all time, its so incredible and
                funny and so many jokes come out of nowhere and still get me. Like im still laughing at an opening being
                liz walking into jacks office saying &ldquo;jack the vending machine is broken&rdquo; and his reply is
                &ldquo;I know, i broek it. I needed to speak with you and i knew it was the fastest way to get you up
                here&rdquo; god i love it. Like the implication that instead of just finding her he went down the
                building with an crowbar, wacked the machine and then waited my works doing an office themed christmas
                party and people keep calling it the best comedy of all time and im keeping my mouth shut about 30 rock
                as i don&#39;t think anyone else will understand it</span></li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">heated rivalry - ok so its very gay. The main guys are both hot but
                the russian guy oh boy. I also think i hate it because its just like one sex scene and then 6 months of
                them ghosting eachother. Will i keep watching it? Unclear, i will only know its on when my timeline is
                flooded with gifs so who knows! </span></li>

            oreos because her sister had made a cheese cake, and it was offered to me. Then she left and i proceeded to
            eat all of it and she came back surprised and i felt so ill. Now why am i telling this story. Idk i think
